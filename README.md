# CarelessWISPer 
Wireless Electronic Shopping Label | 
NCSU Senior Capstone Project 2021

## Introduction
CarelessWISPer, named after the famous (infamous?) George Michael song, is an Electronic Shopping Label System. Engineered
to act as an RFID area reader for consumer products, item tracking, and further applications. Using an ePaper Display, and ESP32 microcontroller, and an RFID module, this product has the capability of giving detailed item descriptions of each product on a shelf. 

## How to Browse

- This github repository is split into 3 main sections: Code, Tutorials, and Fabrication Files
- Within the code section, all of the code that was used to make this project work can be found. Note that this requires the installation of either the Arduino IDE (if you use all the code packed into one .ino file), or the Platform.io extension in Visual Studio to utilize the better and more structured codebase.
- The tutorial section contains descriptions on setting up the database using XAMPP, as well as establishing connection between the ESP32 and ePaper Display. 
- The fabrication section will contain all of the gerber files necessary to fabricate the PCB and needed parts for the project. 

## Installation
To use these code files to implement this system. Read the files contained within the Tutorials section.
